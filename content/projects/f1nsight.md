# F1nsight - Formula 1 Data Analytics Platform

F1nsight is a comprehensive open-source platform that brings Formula 1 data to life through interactive visualizations and in-depth analysis tools.

## Problem Statement

F1 fans lack a unified, comprehensive tool that provides all race insights in one place. With multiple sources offering only partial data, fans struggle to access historical comparisons, live telemetry, and in-depth race metrics, especially with real-time and immersive views.

## Features

- **Detailed Leaderboards**: Comprehensive rankings and statistics for each race
- **Lap Times Analysis**: Performance metrics to study consistency and strategy
- **Tire Strategies**: Analysis of tire choices and their impact on race outcomes
- **Fastest Laps**: Identification of drivers' fastest laps in each event
- **Interactive Telemetry Viewer**: Real-time driver telemetry with various camera angles
- **AR Models**: Augmented reality views of select F1 cars

## Development Workflow

1. Connect to multiple F1 telemetry and data APIs for live data
2. Data preprocessing to enhance accuracy and visualization
3. Create interactive visualizations with Recharts and Three.js
4. Design real-time data display and telemetry insights
5. Integrate AR support for select 3D F1 car models
6. Implement continuous deployment for seamless updates

## Impact & Metrics

- **3,000+ active users** engaging with F1 data daily
- **25 GitHub stars** from the developer community
- **Open source contributions** from F1 enthusiasts worldwide
- **Real-time data processing** for live race analysis

## Future Plans

- **Expanded AR Visualization**: Additional car models and immersive AR experiences
- **Prediction Tools**: Real-time race prediction features
- **Broader Car Models Library**: AR models for a wide array of historical F1 cars
